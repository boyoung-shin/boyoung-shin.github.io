Hello. I am a postdoctoral fellow at Rothenberg lab, Caltech.  I study how gene networks specify immune cell identity and effector function.   In particular, I aim to understand how multilineage-expressed transcription factors exert context-specific gene regulation by synthesizing molecular biology, functional genomics, and cellular immunology approaches.  My research has been focused on identifying molecular features of pathogenic CD4 T cells in chronic inflammation (graduate work) and investigating how transcription factors control gene networks to instruct cell identity programs during early T cell development (postdoctoral work).
